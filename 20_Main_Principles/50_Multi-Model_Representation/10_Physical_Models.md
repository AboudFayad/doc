Physics in SOFA
===============

In the previous doc pages, the integration scheme describes how to compute the configuration at the next time step from the current state. The linear solver explains the step performed to compute the solution of the linear system <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{A}x=b$$" title="Linear system" />. This section explains how the physics contributes to this system.

Mass
----

The Mass of the system will contribute to the left-hand side within the matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{A}$$" title="System matrix" />:

* with direct solvers, the mass is included in the matrix using the function:
``` cpp
addMToMatrix()
```
* with iterative solvers, the mass is taken into account through the function:
``` cpp
addMDx()
```

There is different way of integrating the mass in the system, described below.


### UniformMass ###

This mass is independent of your modeling choices. The total mass is divided by the number of nodes, the mass matrix is diagonal and each value on the diagonal has the same value:
``` cpp
for ( unsigned int i=0; i<indices.size(); i++ )
    res[indices[i]] += dx[indices[i]] * m; // m is constant
```


### MeshMatrixMass ###

This mass integrates the mass density within the topology based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). Thus, the mass is spread on the nodes and edges of the topology. A large element will therefore have a higher associated mass due to its volume:
``` cpp
for (unsigned int i=0; i<dx.size(); i++)
        {
            res[i] += dx[i] * vertexMass[i] * (Real)factor;
            massTotal += vertexMass[i] * (Real)factor;
        }

        for (unsigned int j=0; j<nbEdges; ++j)
        {
            tempMass = edgeMass[j] * (Real)factor;

            v0=_topology->getEdge(j)[0];
            v1=_topology->getEdge(j)[1];

            res[v0] += dx[v1] * tempMass;
            res[v1] += dx[v0] * tempMass;

            massTotal += 2*edgeMass[j] * (Real)factor;
        }
```

### DiagonalMass ###

The diagonal mass is a simplification of the MeshMatrixMass approach. It integrates the mass density within the topology based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, the mass is moved only on integration points (only mass on the nodes, not on edges anymore): this is a numerical lumping. The mass matrix thus becomes diagonal:
``` cpp
for (size_t i=0; i<n; i++)
{
    _res[i] += _dx[i] * masses[i]; // mass different on each node, depending on the topology
}
```



External forces
---------------

Forces can be applied on your physical object. Usually forces are sorted into external and internal forces. Let's consider a simple external force independent from the state <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$x$$" title="DOF" /> of your system. This force will contribute to the right-hand side <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$b$$" title="Right-hand side vector" />: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{A}x=b=f_{ext}$$" title="Right-hand side vector" />

In any forcefield, the vector *b* is filled in the function:
``` cpp
addForce()
```

Taking the example of the *ConstantForceField*:
``` cpp
addForce(const core::MechanicalParams* params, DataVecDeriv& force, const DataVecCoord& position, const DataVecDeriv&)
{
    sofa::helper::WriteAccessor< core::objectmodel::Data< VecDeriv > > _force = force;
	for (unsigned int i=0; i<position.getValue().size(); i++)
		_force[i] += constantForce; // constant value filling the b vector
}
```


Physical laws (internal forces)
-------------------------------

Looking at continuum mechanics, the linear system <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{A}x=b$$" title="Linear system" /> arises from the dynamic equation whichis a time-varying partial differential equation which, after discretization, can be numerically solved as an ordinary differential equation. The system can then be written:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{M}\ddot{x}=f_{ext}-\textstyle\frac{\partial%20E}{\partial%20x}$$" title="Dynamic mechanical system" />

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$x$$" title="DOF at next time step system" /> is the degrees of freedom, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{M}$$" title="Mass matrix" /> the mass matrix, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$E$$" title="Internal energy" /> a scalar function of xâ€”yields the material internal energy, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$f$$" title="Forces" /> a function of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$x$$" title="DOF" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\dot{x}$$" title="DOF derivative" />, describing other forces (constraint forces, internal damping, etc.) acting on our system. The derivative of the internal energy <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$E$$" title="Internal energy" /> will lead to the computation of internal forces notes <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$f=-\textstyle\frac{\partial%20E}{\partial%20x}$$" title="Internal forces" />.

The contribution of the physical law in the linear system will depend on the integration scheme. For this explanation, we will rely on the explicit (or forward) Euler and the implicit (or backward) Euler scheme:

###Explicit case###

In case of an explicit integration, the above system becomes: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{M}\Delta%20v=dt\left(f(x(t))\right)$$" title="Explicit dynamic system" />. The physical law therefore only contributes to the right-hand side <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$b$$" title="RHS vector" /> of the linear system through the function:

``` cpp
addForce() // corresponding to the term : dt f(x(t))
```
SOFA is mainly based on the [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) to integrate in space the physical law, i.e. the contribution of each element of the mesh will be added to the numerical system (here the right-hand side vector <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$b$$" title="RHS vector" />). 


###Implicit case###

In case of an implicit integration, the above system becomes:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{M}\Delta%20v=dt\left(f(x(t))+\textstyle\frac{\partial%20f}{\partial%20x}\Delta%20x+\textstyle\frac{\partial%20f}{\partial%20v}\Delta%20v\right)$$" title="Implicit dynamic system" />
In this equation, we can notice the same explicit contribution <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$dt\left(f(x(t))\right)$$" title="Explicit contribution" />. Just like in the explicit case, this part is implemented in the function
``` cpp
addForce()
```
We can also notice the appearance of the stiffness matrix : <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{K}_{ij}=\textstyle\frac{\partial%20f_i}{\partial%20x_j}$$" title="Implicit contribution" />. The stiffness matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{K}$$" title="Stiffness matrix" /> is a symetric matrix, can either be linear or non-linear regarding <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$x$$" title="DOF" />.


* for **direct solvers**, this is implemented in the *addKToMatrix()* function which will compute and build a matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{K}$$" title="Stiffness matrix" />. The linear system matrix <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?$$\mathbf{A}$$" title="System matrix" /> must be stored and built, since it will be inversed later on to solve the system.
``` cpp
addKToMatrix() // corresponding to the term : - dt  df(x(t+dt))/dx
```
* for **iterative solvers**, this is implemented in the *addDForce()* function which will directly compute the matrix-vector multiplication and store the result into a result vector (no full-built matrix is needed).
``` cpp
addDForce()    // corresponding to the term : - dt  df(x(t+dt))/dx
```
