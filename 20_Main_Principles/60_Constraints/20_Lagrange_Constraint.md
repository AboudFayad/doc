Constraint based on Lagrange Multipliers
========================================

SOFA allows the use of Lagrange multipliers to handle complex constraints, such as contacts and joints between moving objets that can not be straightforwarly implemented using [projection matrices](https://www.sofa-framework.org/community/doc/main-principles/constraints/projective-constraint/).
